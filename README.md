*Dedicated repo for DKG Paranets and IPOs preparation*

AI Para-networks or paranets are autonomously operated structures in the OriginTrail DKG, owned by its community as a paranet operator. In paranets, we find assemblies of Knowledge Assets driving use cases with associated paranet-specific AI services and an incentivization model to reward knowledge miners fueling its growth.

A paranet contains a:

- **a Knowledge Graph**, assembled from paranet **Knowledge assets**, published by knowledge miners. Depending on the paranet specifics, these knowledge assets conform to a set of paranet rules such as containing knowledge about a particular topic, data structured according to defined ontology, etc.

- **paranet services** such as dRAG interfaces, AI agents, smart contracts, data oracles, etc. with on-chain accounts

- **Incentivization model** specifying the rules under which growth activities in the paranet are rewarded, such as knowledge mining and paranet-specific AI services.

- **a "home" blockchain** on which the paranet is running and assembling Knowledge Assets.
